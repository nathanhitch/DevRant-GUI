# DevRant GUI
A Python powered GUI for DevRant 

there are so many things missing right now and some things don't work at all (like ++ and -- )
 
 ## usage
 clone and then run main.py with python 3.6.
  
  as long as you have Tkinter, webbrowser and urllib it should work
  
  ## api
  I'll put the api into its own repo once i've done more on it
